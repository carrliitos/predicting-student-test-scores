    "# Overall EDA Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset overview \n",
    "\n",
    "The training data contains **630,000 rows** and **13 columns**, with the target variable **`exam_score`** (continuous, 0-100 scale). An **`id`** column is a unique identifier (sequential from 0 to 629,999) and is not inherently predictive. The `id` column would need to be removed during feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data quality:**\n",
    "  - **No missing values** across any features or the target.\n",
    "  - Data types are clean and appropriate after casting:\n",
    "    - **Numeric:** `age`, `study_hours`, `class_attendance`, `sleep_hours`, `exam_score`\n",
    "    - **Categorical:** `gender`, `course`, `internet_access`, `sleep_quality`, `study_method`, `facility_rating`, `exam_difficulty`\n",
    "- **Typical student profile (central tendency):**\n",
    "  - **Age:** ~**20.55** years (median **21**, range **17-24**)\n",
    "  - **Study hours:** mean ~**4.00** (median **4.00**, range **0.08-7.91**)\n",
    "  - **Class attendance (%):** mean ~**71.99** (median **72.6**, range **40.6-99.4**)\n",
    "  - **Sleep hours:** mean ~**7.07** (median **7.1**, range **4.1-9.9**)\n",
    "  - **Exam score:** mean ~**62.51** (median **62.6**, range **19.6-100**)\n",
    "- **Spread / variability:**\n",
    "  - `exam_score` has **substantial variability** (std ~**18.92**), suggesting meaningful separation between low- and high-performing students.\n",
    "  - `class_attendance` also varies widely (std ~**17.43**), while `age` is comparatively tight (std ~**2.26**).\n",
    "- **Notable extremes & sanity checks:**\n",
    "  - Very low study time values exist (down to **0.08 hours**), and attendance can be as low as **~40%**, which may represent legitimately low-engagement students rather than data issues (since missingness is zero and ranges look plausible).\n",
    "  - Scores span almost the entire possible scale (**~20 to 100**), indicating no obvious clipping problems.\n",
    "- **Model-readiness implications:**\n",
    "  - This is a **mixed-type regression problem** with several categorical predictors that will require **encoding** (one-hot or target/ordinal encoding depending on the feature).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Engineering TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Split + leakage control\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Create train/validation split **before** fitting any preprocessing steps\n",
    "- [ ] Use a single preprocessing + model **pipeline** (fit on train only, apply to val/test)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Basic cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Drop `id`\n",
    "- [ ] Verify numeric ranges (attendance 0–100, score 0–100, sleep hours plausible)\n",
    "- [ ] Outlier handling (only if needed): clip numeric features to sensible bounds or train-quantiles\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Encoding (keep it simple)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] One-hot encode nominal categoricals: `gender`, `course`, `internet_access`, `study_method`\n",
    "- [ ] Ordinal encode only if truly ordered: `sleep_quality`, `facility_rating`, `exam_difficulty`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Scaling (for stability)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Standardize numeric features: `age`, `study_hours`, `class_attendance`, `sleep_hours`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) Minimal “linear-friendly” feature creation (optional, small set)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Add 1–2 interaction terms. Starting points:\n",
    "  - `study_hours * class_attendance`\n",
    "  - `study_hours * exam_difficulty` (after encoding)\n",
    "- [ ] Add 1 curvature term if residuals suggest nonlinearity:\n",
    "  - `study_hours^2` (or `sleep_hours^2`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6) Multicollinearity + regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Check multicollinearity (VIF or condition number) after encoding\n",
    "- [ ] Prefer **Ridge** as first regularized baseline (stable with many one-hot features)\n",
    "- [ ] Optionally try **Lasso/ElasticNet** for sparsity\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7) Diagnostics + iteration loop\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Check residual plots (nonlinearity, heteroscedasticity)\n",
    "- [ ] Evaluate metrics (MAE/RMSE/R²) and compare against a naive baseline (predict mean)\n",
    "- [ ] Iterate: only add interactions/polynomials if diagnostics show systematic error"
